Risky Portfolio Shares in a Buffer Stock Model.
Consider a consumer who ordinarily behaves according to the tractable buffer stock
model discussed in class. At the end of period t, after the consumption decision has
been made, this consumer is offered a one-time-only, never-to-be-repeated opportunity
to invest in a risky asset. The returns on the asset will be revealed at the beginning of
period t + 1, and thereafter the consumer will behave again according to the optimal
solution to the buffer stock model.
The risky asset’s return factor Rt+1 will take one of two values:


(
Rφ
℘ = (1 − ℘)
with probability 
R̄ = 1−℘
(1)
Rt+1 =
R=0
with probability ℘
where φ > 1 is the ‘risky return premium’ that compensates the consumer for the fact
that the asset is riskier than the safe asset which earns return factor R.
Call the share that the consumer invests in the risky asset ςt . Thus, the consumer
arrives in period t + 1 with bank balances of
b′t+1 =
=
=
=

at (ςt Rt+1 + (1 − ςt )R)
at (R + ςt (Rt+1 − R))
at R (1 + ςt (Rt+1 /R − 1))
bt+1 (1 + ςt ϕt+1 )

where bt+1 = Rat is the amount of bank balances the consumer would have had in the
absence of any investment in the risky asset, and ϕt+1 ≡ (Rt+1 /R − 1) is called the
‘excess return’ on the risky asset.
So, the excess return takes on two possible values:
(
ϕ̄ ≡ R̄
℘−1 with probability 
℘ = (1 − ℘)
(6)
ϕt+1 =
ϕ ≡ −1
with probability ℘
which correspondingly imply two possible realizations of b′t+1 :
(
b̄t+1 ≡ bt+1 (1 + ςt ϕ̄) with probability 
℘ = (1 − ℘)
b′t+1 =
bt+1 ≡ bt+1 (1 − ςt )
with probability ℘

1. Explain why the consumer’s problem is solved by


max ℘ vu (bt+1 )0 + ve (bt+1 + 1)0 + 
℘ vu (b̄t+1 )0 + ve (b̄t+1 + 1)0
ςt

2. Explain why the first order condition for this problem can be rewritten as
Et [ϕt+1 u′ (c(mt+1 ))] = 0

(9)

3. Explain why (9) implies that this consumer will never choose to invest ςt = 1 in
the risky asset.

4. Now define mt+1 = bt+1 + yt+1 as the value that mt+1 would take in the absence of
the opportunity to invest in the risky asset, so that m̀t+1 = mt+1 + bt+1 ϕt+1 ςt and
explain how the consumption function can be approximated by
c(m̀t+1 ) ≈ c(mt+1 ) + c′ (mt+1 )bt+1 ϕt+1 ςt

5. Use the approximation (10) to explain why the consumer will not choose ςt = 0
by showing that at ςt = 0 a small increase in the risky share of the portfolio would
increase expected utility. (Hint: Use (10) in (9)). Explain the intuition behind
this result. (Hint: If none of the portfolio is invested in the risky asset, what is
the covariance between u′ (ct+1 ) and ϕt+1 ?)

6. Using the intuition developed by the foregoing, explain why it is plausible to
suppose that an increase in the magnitude of the unemployment risk might reduce
the extent to which the consumer would be willing to invest in the risky asset.
