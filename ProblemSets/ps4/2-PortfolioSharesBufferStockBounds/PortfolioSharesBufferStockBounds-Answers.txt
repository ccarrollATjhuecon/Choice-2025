Risky Portfolio Shares in a Buffer Stock Model.
Consider a consumer who ordinarily behaves according to the tractable buffer stock
model discussed in class. At the end of period t, after the consumption decision has
been made, this consumer is offered a one-time-only, never-to-be-repeated opportunity
to invest in a risky asset. The returns on the asset will be revealed at the beginning of
period t + 1, and thereafter the consumer will behave again according to the optimal
solution to the buffer stock model.
The risky asset’s return factor Rt+1 will take one of two values:


(
Rφ
℘ = (1 − ℘)
with probability 
R̄ = 1−℘
(1)
Rt+1 =
R=0
with probability ℘
where φ > 1 is the ‘risky return premium’ that compensates the consumer for the fact
that the asset is riskier than the safe asset which earns return factor R.
Call the share that the consumer invests in the risky asset ςt . Thus, the consumer
arrives in period t + 1 with bank balances of
b′t+1 =
=
=
=

at (ςt Rt+1 + (1 − ςt )R)
at (R + ςt (Rt+1 − R))
at R (1 + ςt (Rt+1 /R − 1))
bt+1 (1 + ςt ϕt+1 )

(5)

where bt+1 = Rat is the amount of bank balances the consumer would have had in the
absence of any investment in the risky asset, and ϕt+1 ≡ (Rt+1 /R − 1) is called the
‘excess return’ on the risky asset.
So, the excess return takes on two possible values:
(
ϕ̄ ≡ R̄
℘−1 with probability 
℘ = (1 − ℘)
(6)
ϕt+1 =
ϕ ≡ −1
with probability ℘
which correspondingly imply two possible realizations of b′t+1 :
(
b̄t+1 ≡ bt+1 (1 + ςt ϕ̄) with probability 
℘ = (1 − ℘)
b′t+1 =
bt+1 ≡ bt+1 (1 − ςt )
with probability ℘

1. Explain why the consumer’s problem is solved by


max ℘ vu (bt+1 )0 + ve (bt+1 + 1)0 + 
℘ vu (b̄t+1 )0 + ve (b̄t+1 + 1)0

(8)

ςt

Answer:
The consumer’s goal is to
max Γ1−ρ Et [v(mt+1 )]
ςt

(9)

but since Γ is a constant this is equivalent to
max Et [v(mt+1 )]
ςt

(10)

and (8) simply writes out explicitly the elements of that expected value,
equal to the probability-weighted outcomes that the consumer will experience in each of the four possible conditions: Risky asset bust, unemployed; risky asset bust, employed; risky asset boom, unemployed; risky
asset boom, employed.
2. Explain why the first order condition for this problem can be rewritten as
Et [ϕt+1 u′ (c(mt+1 ))] = 0

(11)

Answer:
The FOC of
max Et [v(at (R + (Rt+1 − R)ςt ) + yt+1 )]

(12)

Et [v′ (mt+1 )(Rt+1 − R)at ] = 0

(13)

ςt

is

but since at is predetermined at the time that ςt is chosen, and since
u′ (ct+1 ) = v′ (mt+1 ), (13) is equivalent to (11) (dividing by R).
3. Explain why (11) implies that this consumer will never choose to invest ςt = 1 in
the risky asset.
Answer:
If the consumer were to invest all his wealth in the risky asset and it
returned Rt+1 = 0, and the consumer also became unemployed in that
same period, his mt+1 would be zero forcing consumption to be zero and
so his marginal utility would be infinity and so the expectation in (11)
could not be satisfied for any ℘ and 0 both > 0.
4. Now define mt+1 = bt+1 + yt+1 as the value that mt+1 would take in the absence of
the opportunity to invest in the risky asset, so that m̀t+1 = mt+1 + bt+1 ϕt+1 ςt and
explain how the consumption function can be approximated by
c(m̀t+1 ) ≈ c(mt+1 ) + c′ (mt+1 )bt+1 ϕt+1 ςt

(14)

Answer:
(14) is a first order Taylor expansion of c(m̀t+1 ) around ςt = 0 using the
definition of (5).
5. Use the approximation (14) to explain why the consumer will not choose ςt = 0
by showing that at ςt = 0 a small increase in the risky share of the portfolio would
increase expected utility. (Hint: Use (14) in (11)). Explain the intuition behind
this result. (Hint: If none of the portfolio is invested in the risky asset, what is
the covariance between u′ (ct+1 ) and ϕt+1 ?)
Answer:
Et [ϕt+1 (u′ (c(mt+1 )) + u′′ (c(mt+1 ))c′ (mt+1 )bt+1 ϕt+1 ςt )] ≈ 0
Following up on the hint, if none of the portfolio is invested in the
risky asset, then the covariance between the risky asset’s returns and
consumption must be zero, because the second term in (5) is zero. But
then for at > 0, since Et [ϕt+1 ] > 0 and Et [u′ (c(mt+1 ))] > 0 and the
covariance is zero, it must be the case that the expectation on the LHS
of is a strictly positive number.
Recall the logic of the C-CAPM model: any asset whose covariance
with consumption is zero, and which earns a positive expected return
premium, must be marginally preferable to the riskless asset. So the
consumer will want to increase his share in the risky asset from zero to
some positive amount.
6. Using the intuition developed by the foregoing, explain why it is plausible to
suppose that an increase in the magnitude of the unemployment risk might reduce
the extent to which the consumer would be willing to invest in the risky asset.
Answer:
The consumer’s problem balances the appeal of the excess return from
in the risky asset (which is irresistible for a consumer who has nothing
invested in it) against the fear of the consequences of investing too
much in the risky asset and experiencing the calamity of a simultaneous
unemployment event and stock market collapse. If the likelihood of the
unemployment calamity increases, it is plausible that the fear of the
simultaneous calamity will become more powerful. Hence, an increase
in unemployment risk can reduce the consumer’s willingness to invest in
the risky asset.
